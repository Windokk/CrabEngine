A 3D Game Engine In C++ created as a test engine for my own portolio.

## Description
The Spark Engine is a 3D Game Engine that allows gam devs to create an environnement for a player to play in. It is created in vs code, but as it is open source, you can edit it on any IDE that you want.

It uses the Open GL [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) Lib for global window management, the [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) lib for all of the mathematics and the [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) lib for the images and textures management.

The engine is in it's pre-alpha state of developpement so there might be a lot of bugs and incomplete features.

## API/Engine Documentation

*Working on it*

*Will be in the "docs" folder*
